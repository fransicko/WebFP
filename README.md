This is a website made for the Final Project.

On this website, we have made it so that a user will be able to log in the store
and purchase some clothing.  The clothing includes men's, women's, and children's.

If the user selects the 'Store' tab, the store will reset and show all the clothing.  If the user selects the "Men's" tab, the store will show only the men's clothing.  If the user selects the "Women's" tab, the store will only show the women's clothing.  The same for the children's tab.

The user can also add items to their cart.  When they do, the cart indicator increases.  The user is also able to look at the items they've added to their cart by going to Profile > Shopping Cart.  Here, the user is able to remove any of the items they have added.  At the bottom of the shopping cart, the user is able to purchase their items.

From the Profile > View Profile tab, the user is able to reset their password by entering their current password.  This will send an email to the user where they can then choose to reset their password.

The cookie is set for the user for 2 hours before the cookie expires.  This cookie keeps track of the logged-in user and is used to pull necessary information such as the user's shopping cart.  Once the cookie expires, the user's shopping list will clear.
